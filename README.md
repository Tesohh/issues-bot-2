# issues-bot-2
a discord bot to help with project management for small teams

## why 2
There was a v1 of this project, which I developed very quickly in about 1-2 weeks,
but the code became an unmantainable mess, and I wanted to add some new features, 
so I figured it would take me less time to start over than to try and add those features.
